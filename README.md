Description:
A simple rendition of a much larger project that I've been working on for the past 4-5 years and have made significant progress in. 
This project showcases the smaller and more interactive features such as traveling, battling, and being rewarded (via xp and an item). 
You additionally have 3 options for main movement and 4 options once engaged in Battle.
You can move between 3 different worlds as you travel and different things and heartless will pop up along the way as you enter different worlds and continue on.
Once you go through all 3 worlds, you successfully win this "Mini-Game"!

Some design considerations all stem from the Kingdom Hearts franchise, thus all the things within the game are either directly from the KH games or something as close as canonically possible to it. 
Despite being a much smaller variant of the main games, I tried my best to overall make it as colorful as I could in a basic sense to somewhat give a lively feel to that of the minigame as well so that it wasn't just plain and bland

Some areas that have already been considered for impovement are quite precisely each of the things that were demonstrated here.
In the much larger scale variant of this game, traveling is more sophisticated, the rewards are much greater, and the battles are more intense with deeper engagement than simple pressing of numbers and keys. 
Strategic Elements are implemented into the real game and allow the player to truly have to focus in order to progress with various different types of keyblades being shown and showcased as well.

The files just contain the simple aspects of the game and nothing further, just a small "Sample" if you will of what's to come in the much larger project
Stay tuned for much larger scale variant of the project!
