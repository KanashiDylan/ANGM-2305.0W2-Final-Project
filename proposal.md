## Description
The plan is to make a smaller version of a project I've been personally working on for almost 4 years now. I'm going to create a fighting system similar to that of Pokemon that furthers that takes on a twist utilizing things like XP, Health Bars, potentially "learning attacks", and more down the line as I come up with this.
## Features
- Feature 1: Health and Magic Bars
  - The plan is to create variables or perhaps a Library that houses the Health and Magic status for the player which can be called back to for each fight the character gets into and either increased or decreased based on certain actions
- Feature 2: Full Working Battle System
  - The idea here is to create a Pokemon style (Or just generally Turn Based) fighting style that includes Inventory, different attacks with different damage ranges, the loss and or increase of health, the use of magic abilities (thus depleting the magic bar), random enemy choices that shift and vary with each fight (so that you're not constantly fighting the same enemy), and possibly a form the character can transform into mid battle based on certain conditions (If there's even time for something like that)
- Feature 3: Reward System
  - An XP/Level System for the overall mechanic that can increase the players health (I don't think there will be time for this but I'd want to add like items to the player based on a certain level the player hits that can then be used in their next battle), and a reward system after each fight (Players getting XP and various items (maybe varying depending on who or what is defeated))

## Challenges
- The concept of having a back and forth fight will probably be pretty difficult here and then looping that fight to not affect the current level, items held, etc. Whatever skill that may take (other than maybe a large amount of if/then variables or perhaps just finding what a simpler way to achieve this would be)

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- We have a full working short battling system that includes all of what I wanted to accomplish with each of the bells and whistles that I want to add for it

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Just having only the back and forth bit of it working, like at least the turn based thing working (not the inventory, form, varying enemies, etc.)

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Set up the actual inventory list, variable, or Library
  2. Create the Library as a whole for all the players functions and things like Health

- Week 2
  1. Have started the Battling portion and have made a good amount of progress into almost just finishing it
  2. Work on some of the bells and whistles like the item system and each items various effects

- Week N (Final)
  1. Have completed the battling system and solely be working on Bells and Whistles from here
  2. Maybe add another feature not intially listed on the Features list that can add yet another bell and whistle to this
